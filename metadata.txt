description=Compute the network of Least-Cost Paths between multiple origins and destinations based on a cost surface map
version=version 0.1.3
author=Xavier Rubio-Campillo
email=xavier.rubio@ed.ac.uk

about=LCPNetwork applies Dijkstra's algorithm to get optimal paths between a the features of 2 point vector layers. You will also need to specify a raster map of costs such as slope or a prominence index. The plugin will generate an accumulated cost map for each of the points and a line vector layer with all the optimal paths which can be used for further analysis. The current version will freeze the UI until the algorithm finishes. Computing time can be very large for high-resolution cost surface maps.
